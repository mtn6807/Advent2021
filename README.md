# Advent2021
## Day One
Jingle dropped Santa's sleigh keys into the water. I am added to a special team of elves tasked with retrieving the keys. Our best scientists say that our antanae 
are not strong enough to locate the keys, unless we retrieve 50 gold stars which boost the strength of ours sensors. We all board the sub and close the hatch. The 
noise anyone can hear are the creaks and groans of the sub, and the blip of the sonar. As I looked to the good elves on my left and right it was clear we all knew 
the gravity of the situation. We must save Christmas and we must go to into the depths of the ocean to do so.

## Day Two
The sonar blips continue, as the submarine sinks below the surface. The captain comes to the front of the team and requests our pilot come to the front. A small elf 
from the back, steps forward. "Sir I'm not so sure I can do this" says the nervous elf, "I've only ever piloted sleds, and this is not the same at all". You can hear 
a murmur throughout the crowd until the captains speaks up, "We can overcome this obstacle as a team, we will figure out the piloting instructions; we must figure 
out the piloting instructions". Our team gets to work, the sub is sinking and no one knows how to pilot this sub. As the sub is about to hit the walls we figure it 
out. We're saved.

## Day Three
It is only the third day, and we've already avoided to grave problems. We spend most of the day hoping we don't face any more problems, but our hope was short lived. 
The lights flicker, and for a brief moment our pilot loses control of the sub. We rush to the diagnostics to find out what is happening with our poewr consumption. 
We look on in horror as we have no idea how to decipher the readings. Luckily somone recognized the reporting as binary. We radioed the binary code back to The North 
Pole, and we lost power. At anymoment our sub could hit something in the ocean and our mission could end along with all of us. After almost the whole day our power 
comes back on; and we recieve the report back from The North Pole. We find out that one of our engineers, Tingle, had a private refrigerator no one knew about which drew too 
much power. From then on Tingle had to go without his private stash of peppermint icecream. Thankfully now that we had power back when we needed to check our subsystems 
to be safe we were quickly able to get the results back from The North Pole.
